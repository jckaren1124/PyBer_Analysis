# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to gain a better understanding of how ride-sharing data differs by city type: urban, suburban, and rural.  This information can then provide insights on how to improve rider and driver experience as well as areas that require additional support.

## Results

The PyBer summary chart indicates that urban cities utilize ride-sharing services most frequently as they account for 68.4% of the total combined rides of all city types, 80.9% of the total combined drivers of all city types, and 62.7% of the combined total fares of all city types.  Rural cities have the least number of total rides, total drivers, and total fares.  Average fare per ride and average fare per driver is lowest among urban cities and highest within rural cities.  The numbers for suburban cities are somewhere in the middle for all five categories. There is also a rather large discrepancy in average fare per driver between rural ($55.49) and urban ($16.57) cities.  The fare difference between average fare per ride is a bit smaller amongst the city types. 

The line graph showing total fares by city type indicates an interesting trend. A sharp drop in total fares occured in April for urban and suburban cities, while fares remained relatively low and steady in rural cities from mid-March through the end of April.  For all city types, a peak in total fares occured in late February.

## Summary

Since total fares are at the lowest point in April for all city types, perhaps that would be a good time to run a special promotion to entice more users.  From the gathered data, rural cities have the lowest total fares amongst all city types. PyBer can potentially find ways to target advertising to rural cities in hopes of increasing users of their service. A final suggestion would be to provide riders and drivers incentives for feedback on their ridesharing experiences. The data results seem to raise additional questions that require additional information. Is the reason rural cities have higher average fares due to riders riding longer distances, or due to fewer driver availability?  Is the reason fewer people in rural cities utilize ridesharing service due to the cost of rides being too high or the greater number of people owning vehicles? Many factors can influence a personâ€™s transportation decisions, and additional information can help companies make strategic decisions.
